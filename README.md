A repository for the code I used to find the seeds in this video: [TODO link]()
<br>
You can find all the world seeds in `src/main/resources/world_seeds.txt`, 
and some other intermediate results in other files under `src/main/resources/`.

## How to run
Import the project into your favorite IDE that supports Gradle, the build
should be done automatically.

## Acknowledgements
The code uses external seedfinding libraries: [LattiCG](https://github.com/mjtb49/LattiCG) and [mc_feature_java](https://github.com/SeedFinding/mc_feature_java),
<br> which made the project possible. Go give them the stars they deserve :)
